# GIT & GITHUB
In this section I learnt about how code collaborations takes place and how these codes are managed from a single source called repository

## LEARNING STEPS

### Getting Started:
To get started, the git client must first be installed on the user's device. For this training, I installed it directly from my Ubuntu CLI using 
```apt install git```

Also, create a new repo on Github (which is exactly this repo you are curently). I have an account on Github before. If you don't, create an account before you will be able to create a repo.

### Cloning Repo locally on your system
This just means, in layman terms, you want to download the repository onto your system so that you can work with the file. But in this type of download, the downloaded files is still partially linked to the repository on your Github.
To clone repo:
- on the repo dashboard, click the code button and navigate HTTPS Panel and copy the code
- go to the CLI and type the following code
```git clone <the code you copied>```
